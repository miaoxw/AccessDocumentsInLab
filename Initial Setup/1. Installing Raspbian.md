#Installing Raspbian
##Write img file to microSD card
In every kind of OS, we have convenient ways to write the system image file into our new microSD card.  
Before that, downloading the OS image is a must. [This is the official link of the newest Raspbian image.](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest)

###Windows
* Download Win32DiskImager.
* Run Win32DiskImager **as Administration**.
* Choose the img file and correct destination desk, click on `Write`.
* Wait for a couple of monutes, and it will be done.

###Linux
* Run `df -h` to see what devices are being mounted, and determine which is the microSD card we plugged in.
* Unmount all partitions on that microSD card with command `umount`.
* In Linux, the command `dd` is powerful enough. Run the command like this:  

		dd bs=4M if=2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie.img of=/dev/sdc
	* Remember to run this command with root authorization.
	* If you want to see the progress, run `pkill -USR1 -n -x dd` in another terminal.
* When dd finishes its work, check the result with command `diff` if necessary.
* Run `sync` to ensure the write cache is flushed.

###Mac OS
*I'm not familiar with Mac, so this part may be quite brief. I believe doing that in graphical interface is quite enough.*

* Make sure the microSD card is formatted as FAT32 in advance.
* Determine the proper device name in `Apple menu`->`About this Mac`->`More Info...`
* Once remembering the device name, unmount it.
* Run the similar `dd` command.
