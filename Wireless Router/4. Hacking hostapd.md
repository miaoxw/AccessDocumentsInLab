# Hacking `hostapd`
Even if we have set up 40Mhz bandwith in IEEE 802.11, we might depressedly find that the actual speed rate is not as fast as we thought. Many blogs point out that this has something to do with `hostapd`, which strictly puts IEEE specification. When turning on debug mode, we can see the reason.

	20/40 MHz operation not permitted on channel pri=6 sec=10 based on overlapping BSSes

IEEE 802.11n specification seems to have defined the rule whether to use 40MHz mode or not. One principle is when the neighbour channel is in heavy traffic, the second channel shouldn't be enabled, that is to say falling back to 20MHz. **However,** almost all wireless routers in the market now refuse to obey this rule. In this case, we can never get chance to make use of 40MHz mode because in modern cities there are so many WiFi hotspots.

Therefore, I think we have the right not to set up our wireless network on advice of IEEE specification so strictly. Some hacking is necessary.

This instruction referred to [a blog by Anthony Wong](http://blog.anthonywong.net/2015/07/19/boost-wifi-speed-raspberry-pi-hostapd/) and [another by Li Chi](http://blog.csdn.net/subfate/article/details/52177035).
 
## Get the source code of `hostapd`
* If ever step in the instructions before is followed, `deb-src` source must have been added. Just type in:

		apt-get source hostapd
* Install all compilation dependencies of the source code.

		apt-get build-dep hostapd

## Modify source code
The following instruction is base on the source wpa-2.3.

In file `/src/ap/hw_features.c`,we can find out the basic logic to decide to use 20MHz or 40MHz mode:

```C
static void ieee80211n_check_scan(struct hostapd_iface *iface)
{
        struct wpa_scan_results *scan_res;
        int oper40;
        int res;

        /* Check list of neighboring BSSes (from scan) to see whether 40 MHz is
         * allowed per IEEE Std 802.11-2012, 10.15.3.2 */

        iface->scan_cb = NULL;

        scan_res = hostapd_driver_get_scan_results(iface->bss[0]);
        if (scan_res == NULL) {
                hostapd_setup_interface_complete(iface, 1);
                return;
        }

		//Pay attention HERE!
        if (iface->current_mode->mode == HOSTAPD_MODE_IEEE80211A)
                oper40 = ieee80211n_check_40mhz_5g(iface, scan_res);
        else
                oper40 = ieee80211n_check_40mhz_2g4(iface, scan_res);
        wpa_scan_results_free(scan_res);

        iface->secondary_ch = iface->conf->secondary_channel;
        if (!oper40) {
                wpa_printf(MSG_INFO, "20/40 MHz operation not permitted on "
                           "channel pri=%d sec=%d based on overlapping BSSes",
                           iface->conf->channel,
                           iface->conf->channel +
                           iface->conf->secondary_channel * 4);
                iface->conf->secondary_channel = 0;
                if (iface->drv_flags & WPA_DRIVER_FLAGS_HT_2040_COEX) {
                        /*
                         * TODO: Could consider scheduling another scan to check
                         * if channel width can be changed if no coex reports
                         * are received from associating stations.
                         */
                }
        }

        res = ieee80211n_allowed_ht40_channel_pair(iface);
        if (!res) {
                iface->conf->secondary_channel = 0;
                wpa_printf(MSG_INFO, "Fallback to 20 MHz");
        }

        hostapd_setup_interface_complete(iface, !res);
}
```

Obviously, the variant `oper40` is used as a flag. A lazy modification is of course to simply forcefully set `oper40` to 1. So, just add a line:

```C
        oper40=1;
```

Done.

## Compile and install
* Change the working directory to the source code directory, such as `~/wpa-2.3/`.
* Use `fakeroot` to get temporary permission to compile:

		fakeroot debian/rules binary
* Compilation takes some time. Just wait patiently.
* After compilation, return to the upper directory. There is a `deb` file named like `hostapd_2.3-1+deb8u3_armhf.deb`. Use `dpkg` command to install it manually.
* Reboot your Raspberry Pi and then enjoy faster network!
